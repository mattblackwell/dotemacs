This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration.

* What the .el

If you are wondering where has gone all of the Lisp, fear not, for it is
automagically tangled from this Org file into a Lisp file with Org.

* Screenshots

My Emacs configuration is a living mixture that I edit on a daily basis. As
such, the following screenshots might not reflect exactly what is on =:master=.

/More coming soon/ :tm:

* Installation

I primarily use Emacs on MacOS, but I trust your /google-fu/ to find the
equivalent for the following commands to run on your setup.

** Emacs

I use [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Emacs Plus]]. The
configuration files /should/ work with any build nonetheless. In any case,
install Emacs 24 or above.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus --with-no-title-bars --without-spacemacs-icon
git clone https://github.com/angrybacon/dotemacs.git ~/.emacs.d/
#+END_SRC

** Ag

My Ivy setup uses =ag= instead of =grep= to lookup files.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sh brew install the_silver_searcher
#+END_SRC

** Flycheck

I use [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] as linter framework to
display syntax warnings and errors whithin each buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install flake8                       # Python gem install
scss_lint scss_lint_reporter_checkstyle  # SCSS
npm install -g eslint                    # JavaScript
#+END_SRC

** Material Design Icons

There are special characters in the mode-line. Install
[[https://materialdesignicons.com][the font]].
